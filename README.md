# CV-Template

## About
This repository contains the LaTeX file that I use for my CV (Resume). It is primarily designed to be a single-page, but should work just as well with multiple pages.

## Why LaTeX?
It may seem a bit overkill, but once you have your template working with LaTeX it tends to be much easier to maintain versus something written in Microsoft Word, Especially when it comes to positioning text and/or elements which may not follow the normal flow.

## How to use
Replace the placeholder content in `cv.tex` with your information, compile into a PDF (or some other format of your choosing) and you're done! 

I personally use [TexWorks](https://tug.org/texworks/#Getting_TeXworks), but any TeX editor should work.

## Example
