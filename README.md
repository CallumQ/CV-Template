# CV-Template

## About
This repository contains the LaTeX file that I use for my CV (Resume). It is primarily designed to be a single-page, but should work just as well with multiple pages.

## Why LaTeX?
It might seem a bit overkill, but once you have your structure working in LaTex it tends to be very easy to maintain without much difficultu versus something like Microsoft Word. 

## How to use
Replace the placeholder content with your information, compile into a PDF (or some other format of your choosing) and you're done!
